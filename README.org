* Additional Regexp Engines (for Emacs)

~are~ is a dynamic module for Emacs that implements support for
additional regular expression engines.  ~PCRE2~ is currently the only
supported engine, but it should be easy to add more engines (see
~src/are_pcre2.c~ for a starting point).

The idea is to reimplement commonly used Emacs functions for working
with regular expressions in a compatible manner.  This should allow
users to override regexp functions through the use of ~advice~ or
~let-bindings~.


** Status

These functions have been implemented:

| Emacs              | ARE                    |
|--------------------+------------------------|
| occur              | are-occur              |
| re-search-backward | are-re-search-backward |
| re-search-forward  | are-re-search-forward  |
| string-match       | are-string-match       |


** Installation

To install the required dependencies on a Debian-based system:

#+begin_src sh
$ sudo apt-get install automake libtool uthash-dev libpcre2-dev
#+end_src

And to install ~are~ in ~$HOME/.emacs.d/are~:

#+begin_src sh
$ ./autogen
$ ./configure --prefix="$HOME/.emacs.d/are"
$ make
$ make install
#+end_src

To use ~are~, add the two subdirectories ~$HOME/.emacs.d/are/lib~ and
~$HOME/.emacs.d/are/share/are~ to ~load-path~.
